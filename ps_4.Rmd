# Question 1
There were `r data %>% filter(response == "Dem") %>% summarize(n())` respondents who supported the Democratic candidate.

There were ```{r} data %>% 
  group_by(response) %>% 
  filter(response %in% c("Rep", "Und")) %>% 
  summarize(n())``` more respondents who favored the Republican candidate than who were Undecided.

There are two gender variables (gender and gender_combined). There are `r data %>% 
  filter(gender != gender_combined) %>% 
  summarize(n())` individuals for whom these variables have different values.

There are `r data %>% 
  filter(race_eth == "White", file_race_black != "White") %>% 
summarize(n())` respondents listed as “White” under race_eth who are not listed as “White” under file_race_black.

The first response of Rep came X minutes (rounded to the nearest minute) before the first response of Dem.
